This is a brief explanation of menus system.
Menus are extensible, any module can plug a menu in any sub-part of another menu.
For an example see main-menu.xml, status.xml from module status_ui and minigl.xml from minigl_ui.
Menus in different modules should have different names, otherwise one will override another in the building process and which is the winner is not specified.
We currently support menus at any levels and the use of separators, see System sub menu of main-menu.xml for an example.
The order in which menus are displayed is ruled by their weight the higher the weight the lower they appear, when in an xml a weight is defined in a node, the next menus have their wight incremented one by one until another weight is defined, because of this secuentially defined items are automatically ordered.
In case duplicated weight appear (ideally this should not occur) the coincident are ordered by name alphabetically.
